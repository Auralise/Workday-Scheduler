# Workday Scheduler
Bootcamp Week 5 - jQuery and Bootstrap powered Day planner

## Purpose
This is a workday scheduler program designed to allow you to create items that are saved for each hour period of the working day (9am-5pm). When the save button is clicked, it saves the entries in a time segment to local storage allowing for the retreival when the page is loaded again.

The application will also highlight the current time segment in Red and colour the future segments with Green and the past segments with Grey. 

It also utilises moment.js to handle dates and times.
